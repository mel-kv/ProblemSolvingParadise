Used algorithms in different programming languages:

Python:
Sorting Algorithm: Tim Sort (a hybrid sorting algorithm based on Merge Sort and Insertion Sort).
Implementation: Python's built-in sorted() function and the list.sort() method use Tim Sort. Tim Sort was introduced in Python 2.3 and has been the standard sorting algorithm since then.

Java:
Sorting Algorithm: Dual-Pivot Quick Sort (Java 7 onwards), Tim Sort (Java 8 onwards for objects, Java 7 for arrays of objects).
Implementation: Java's Arrays.sort() method typically uses a variant of Dual-Pivot Quick Sort for primitive types and Tim Sort for objects. Java's standard sorting algorithm for arrays of objects changed from Merge Sort to Tim Sort starting from Java 7.

JavaScript:
Sorting Algorithm: Tim Sort (a variant of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort).
Implementation: JavaScript's built-in Array.prototype.sort() method uses Tim Sort. This algorithm was introduced in ECMAScript 5, so it's supported by most modern JavaScript engines.

C++:
Sorting Algorithm: Introsort (a hybrid sorting algorithm based on Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort).
Implementation: The C++ Standard Library's std::sort() function typically uses Introsort, which is a combination of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort. Introsort is designed to provide good average-case performance while still ensuring worst-case O(n log n) time complexity.

C#:
Sorting Algorithm: Introspective Sort (a hybrid sorting algorithm based on Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort).
Implementation: The .NET Framework's Array.Sort() method (in C#) typically uses Introspective Sort, which combines Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort. Similar to C++, this algorithm is designed to provide good performance across various scenarios.

Ruby:
Sorting Algorithm: Quick Sort (previously Merge Sort before Ruby 1.9), Introsort.
Implementation: Ruby's built-in sort method (e.g., Array#sort) typically uses Quick Sort or Introsort. Before Ruby 1.9, Merge Sort was used, but it was replaced by Quick Sort in later versions.
