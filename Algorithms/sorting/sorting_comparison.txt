Comparison of sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
Space Complexity: O(1) - it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
Stability: Stable - it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Inefficient for large datasets, suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

***

Selection Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases (worst, average, and best).
Space Complexity: O(1) - it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
Stability: Not stable - it may change the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Inefficient for large datasets, suitable for small datasets or situations where minimizing the number of swaps is crucial.

***

Insertion Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case, O(n) in the best case (when the array is nearly sorted).
Space Complexity: O(1) - it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
Stability: Stable - it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Inefficient for large datasets, suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

***

Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best).
Space Complexity: O(n) - it requires additional space for merging.
Stability: Stable - it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Efficient for large datasets, suitable for any type of input data, including linked lists.

***

Quick Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the average case, O(n^2) in the worst case (when the pivot selection is poor).
Space Complexity: O(log n) to O(n) - it requires additional space for the recursive call stack.
Stability: Not stable - it may change the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Efficient for large datasets on average, may be less suitable for certain distributions of input data.

***

Heap Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best).
Space Complexity: O(1) - it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
Stability: Not stable - it may change the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Efficient for large datasets, suitable for situations where stability is not a requirement.

***

Radix Sort:
Time Complexity: O(nk) - where n is the number of elements and k is the number of passes (digits) required to sort the numbers.
Space Complexity: O(n + k) - it requires additional space for buckets.
Stability: Stable if used with a stable counting sort implementation.
Suitability: Efficient for sorting integers when the number of digits (k) is relatively small.

***

Tim Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best).
Space Complexity: O(n) - it requires additional space for merging.
Stability: Stable - it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Suitability: Efficient for large datasets, suitable for any type of input data, well-suited for real-world scenarios.



Which Sorting Algorithm Should I Use?
It depends. Each algorithm comes with its own set of pros and cons.



- Quicksort is a good default choice. It tends to be fast in practice, and with some small tweaks its dreaded O(n**2) worst-case time complexity becomes very unlikely. A tried and true favorite.

- Heap sort is a good choice if you can't tolerate a worst-case time complexity of O(n**2) or need low space costs. The Linux kernel uses heap sort instead of quicksort for both of those reasons.

- Merge sort is a good choice if you want a stable sorting algorithm. Also, merge sort can easily be extended to handle data sets that can't fit in RAM, where the bottleneck cost is reading and writing the input on disk, not comparing and swapping individual items.

- Radix sort looks fast, with its O(n) worst-case time complexity. But, if you're using it to sort binary numbers, then there's a hidden constant factor that's usually 32 or 64 (depending on how many bits your numbers are). That's often way bigger than O(lg(n)), meaning radix sort tends to be slow in practice.

- Counting sort is a good choice in scenarios where there are small number of distinct values to be sorted. This is pretty rare in practice, and counting sort doesn't get much use.
